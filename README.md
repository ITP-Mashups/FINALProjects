Describe the assignment
To create a webpage that upon user interaction retrieves data from an API and some display from a js library.

Discuss what you chose to do and why
I chose to create a website where someone can enter a random word in the search bar and then a song with that word in the lyrics will appear, and the artist of that some would appear, along with the floating lyrics around the screen. I thought this would be really cool and funny.

Document any resources/research/inspiration
p5 library, my friends who can find any song and sing to any word that someone says
 
Explain your process
I was exploring the p5 library and the best way to the display lyrics on a page
 
Highlight both successes and failures
Successes: I am getting better at learning js, and have learned how to split information from the data. While I understand how to read code, and when you told me how to split the lyrics up into individual words on Thursday, however I have a hard time writing the code on my own. It makes sense after someone tells it to me, but I need to work on learning how to write it myself. Though I am not where I would like to be at in my coding knowledge, I will take the time off to focus on writing code on my own. 

Failures: 
1. I Couldn’t get p5 to work with the search results- data from aan api. I tried looking at Izzy's code, but did not have enough time to figure it out. I am going to try and figure this out before I start ITP so that I can get a good head start.
2. I wanted to get the user's search word to display on page but the api doesn’t give the full lyrics, just the first few stanzas so if it’s not in the first few stanzas but in the song elsewhere, the word won’t display on the page
3. I tried uploading the code pages to a hosting website but for some reason only half of the website was working...I will need to figure that out when I eventually start creating my portfolio at ITP.
