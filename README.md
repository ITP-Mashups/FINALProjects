#Finals

This is Charmaine Sum's work for 8/10/2017

The idea of this project is to get data from a very interesting api source and allow the users to have a very fun browsing experience. I also want to learn how to use a brand new api that is different from my midterm. I started off by really wanting to use the Marvel API from https://developer.marvel.com/. However, over the entire weekend, I couldnt gain access to the Marvel API because of access issue. What I found out was that they only allow us to access this through the backend. 

So with this not working too well, I have decided to use the Cooper Hewitt API because I know how it works really well.  

With the Cooper Hewitt API, I knew I wanted to explore the vast amount of images that are shown. I wanted to allow the user to experience the images in a fun and interactive way. I first found the library http://camanjs.com/api/ where I wanted to use this to allow the user to edit the images. However, after a whole afternoon of linking the api images to the buttons, I realized that they do not support images that are not pre uploaded. I was really disappointed by this restriction because it was not shown in the documentations.

After this, I decided to try P5 but I also ran into the issue of the preload() images. As the deadline is so close, I decided to look for other fun libraries. What I found was really fun was fotorama. I decided to use a fun image player so that the user can try to experience the art works through a fun gallary format. I also learned how to create a local host on my computer through MAMP PRO.  

I then decided to implement this p5 drawing pad in the bottom to let users copy the images in an abstract format. I was running into the issue of the draw function because I couldn't figure out how to drawn objects from disappearing whenever the code runs. I tried to do an object loop like Calli recommended but I did not seem to know how to save it.

I think my biggest success was finally finding a library that could work well with the image API. That was a big challenge for me. I wish I could do even more with the images but I think with the limited time, this is a good photo viewing application. I wish I did not look for a new api and just stayed with the pixabay api if I knew it was so diffcult to link images to the librarys. Overall, I enjoyed this project because I learned a lot of new skills and I learned a lot about what are the diffculties to access APIs through the front end side.
