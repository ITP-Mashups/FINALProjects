# PoetryRandomizer
A front-end web application that uses the poetryDB api (https://github.com/thundercomb/poetrydb) and RiTa.js to retrieve and randomize poems based on user input.

*-----------Known Issues------------*
>>Unfortunately there are some CORS problems with the Ajax request to poetryDB. The RiTa functionality of the app can be seen here:

>>Can be found at http://159.203.170.193:8082/ and will work if chrome is started without CORS security flag (instructions here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3102819/disable-same-origin-policy-in-chrome)
